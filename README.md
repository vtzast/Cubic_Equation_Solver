## Cubic Equation Solver

A Cubic Equation Solver for calculating the roots of cubic polynomials based on the Cardano's mathematical formula.
Roots are rounded to two decimal places.

Poylynomial structure:

if A = 0 the roots are estimated by an Quadratic Equation Solver

The roots are consistent with the ones that someone can acquire using the 
Cubic Equation Solver by Wolfram|Alfa Widgets.
